# Grapple-Game
_____
This is a repository for CSCE 496 - Virtual Reality. It contains an (as of yet) unnamed game about escaping a cave with grappling hooks.

## Milestone One
Our first milestone was dedicated towards the creation of core game mechanics. Of note are the great environmental renderings done by Mattie Mcintosh, the pressure plate mechanic done by Isaac Logdson, the grapple mechanic done by Ryan McManaman, and the great soundtrack by Jack Johnson.

For our demo, we've prepared a small scene containing a simple puzzle - the player will spawn next to a gate and a pressure plate. On the other side of the gap is an item to weigh down the pressure plate with. In order to make progress, the player needs to grapple to the other platform to retrieve the cube, which they'll use to weigh down the pressure plate on the original platform.
